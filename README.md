# Basketball API

This is a basketball API that allows users to select 10 random basketball players and view their stats. The API is built using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. The frontend of the application is built using React. 

The user can toggle the stats of the players to see various information, such as their height, weight, position, and team. A refresh button is also available which will make a request and fetch 10 new random players to select from.
